I am a hobbyist photographer looking for creative and fun people to shoot with.I&amp;rsquo;m keen to try all styles of photography so if you have ideas then let me know. My shoot ethics are simple, not to go outside the model&amp;rsquo;s comfort zone, not to be pushy and keep it relaxed, I like to listen to other people&amp;rsquo;s ideas as sometimes that can be one of the best shots in the end.</description></item><item><title>Chaperone Policy</title><link>https://patrickv82.github.io/nl/about/chaperone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 19:48:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://patrickv82.github.io/nl/about/chaperone/</guid><description>Occasionally models ask if they may bring a chaperone to the shoot. Unlike some photographers, we are generally fairly welcoming to chaperones. However we do have some important conditions. Firstly we would prefer it not to be your boyfriend please. Boyfriends tend to get bored and want attention. Remember, our role is to photograph the model, not to entertain or educate her chaperone. We also must insist on knowing who your chaperone is in advance.</description></item></channel></rss>
